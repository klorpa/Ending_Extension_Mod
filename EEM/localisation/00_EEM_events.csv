EVTNAME166300;The Chinese Rite;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC166300;The Taiping have overthrown the Qing dynasty. They claim to be Christians, but their rituals are mixed with strange Chinese practices, and more worringly, their leader claims to be Jesus Christ's little brother!

EVT166300OPTA;The Taiping are heretics!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT166300OPTB;They believe in God too, do they not?;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVT166303OPTB;Discourage them and hope they leave. Our Christianization efforts will suffer, however.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME166308;The Pope Condemns the Taiping;;;;;;;;;;;;;
