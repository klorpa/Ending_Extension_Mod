EVTDESC23110;"Everything must be put to fire and sword, men, women and children and old men must be slaughtered and not a tree or house be left standing." \nKaiser Wilhelm II in a letter to Kaiser Franz Joseph \n"burning homes, rounding up villagers--men, women, and in some cases children--and shooting groups of them: six at Warsage, fifty at Seilles, nearly four hundred at Tamines and over six hundred at Dinant. The medieval town of Louvain was heavily shelled and its university's library, a treasure-house of ancient manuscripts, was torched." \nOur war policies have encouraged our troops to commit several massacres in recently occupied territory.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTNAME166220;The Nian Rebellion;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC166220;What began as groups of poor roaming peasants displaced by the 1851 Yellow River flood grew into larger and larger bandit gangs after years of Qing mismanagement. Finally, under Zhang Lexing, the bands were organized into a loose alliance of five banners. Although their coordination with the other rebels is poor, the fast-moving Nian cavalry is well suited to looting operations.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT166220OPTA;More rebel scum!;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTNAME166300;The Chinese Rite;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC166300;The Taiping have overthrown the Qing dynasty. They claim to be Christians, but their rituals are mixed with strange Chinese practices, and more worringly, their leader claims to be Jesus Christ's little brother! The Pope is considering how to respond to this development, and since we own Rome, we can influence the Holy See's decision.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT166300OPTA;The Taiping are heretics!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT166300OPTB;They believe in God too, do they not?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME166301;Taiping American Relations;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC166301;The Taiping have overthrown the Qing dynasty. Since their leader, Hong Xiuquan, studied under the American Southern Baptist missionary, Reverend Issachar Jacox Roberts, American missionaries in China feel welcome by the new government! More American missionaries are on their way to China as we speak.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT166301OPTA;God has finally reached the Chinese.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME166302;Pro-Qing Intervention?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC166302;Chinese Rebels have overthrown the Qing dynasty, undoing our hard work opening China up to our merchants. However, reminants of the Qing court survive in Manchuria, perhaps with our support they could restore order in China. Our contacts in Manchuria say the Qing are ready to give us a consession if we succeed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT166302OPTA;Support the Manchu!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT166302OPTB;We should leave the Chinese alone.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME166303;American Missionaries Arrive!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC166303;American missionaries, inspired by our nation's new Christian faith, have arrived in significant numbers, ready to help us spread the word of God.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT166303OPTA;Welcome them!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT166303OPTB;Discourage them and hope they leave. Our Christianization efforts will suffer, however.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME166308;The Pope Condemns the Taiping;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC166308;The Pope condemned the Taiping for heresy! This is the perfect chance to show the Chinese their place and grab concessions from them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT166308OPTA;We will crush those heretics!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT166308OPTB;We shouldn't waste our time with colonial adventures.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME166309;The Pope Supports the Taiping;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC166309;The Pope has been moved by our Christian faith and declared that we are in full communion with God!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT166309OPTA;Praise Jesus! (and His Brother!);;;;;;;;;;;;;
