EVTNAME166220;The Nian Rebellion;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC166220;What began as groups of poor roaming peasants displaced by the 1851 Yellow River flood grew into larger and larger bandit gangs after years of Qing mismanagement. Finally, under Zhang Lexing, the bands were organized into a loose alliance of five banners of rebel troops.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT166220OPTA;More rebel scum!;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVT166222OPTA;Welcome to the Revolution;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME166300;The Chinese Rite;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC166300;The Taiping have overthrown the Qing dynasty. They claim to be Christians, but their rituals are mixed with strange Chinese practices, and more worryingly, their leader claims to be Jesus Christ's little brother! The Pope is considering how to respond to this development, and since we own Rome, we can influence the Holy See's decision.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT166300OPTA;The Taiping are heretics!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT166300OPTB;They believe in God too, do they not?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME166301;Taiping-American Relations;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC166301;INCOMPLETE DESC The Taiping have overthrown the Qing dynasty. Although the Taiping claim to be Christian, Southern Baptist missionary Issachar Jacox Roberts claims that the Taiping religion deviates too radically from real Christianity.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT166301OPTA;Teach the Chinese how to worship properly.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT166301OPTB;Don't bother;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME166302;Pro-Qing Intervention?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC166302;Rebels have overthrown the Qing dynasty, undoing years of hard work opening China up to our merchants. However, remnants of the Qing court survive in Manchuria. Perhaps with our support the Qing could restore order in China. Contacts in Manchuria say the Qing are ready to give us a concession if the plan were to succeed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT166302OPTA;Propose the plan to Manchuria.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT166302OPTB;Who cares about Chinese conflict?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME166303;American Missionaries Arrive;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC166303;American missionaries, inspired by our nation's new Christian faith, have arrived in significant numbers, ready to spread the word of God. However, the entry of more discourteous foreigners and the differences between Taiping and Western Protestant doctrine may cause unrest and instability.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT166303OPTA;Welcome the missionaries.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT166303OPTB;Discourage the missionaries.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME166308;The Pope Condemns the Taiping;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC166308;The Pope has condemned the Taiping for heresy! This is the perfect chance to show the Chinese their place and obtain concessions from them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT166308OPTA;Let's crush those heretics!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT166308OPTB;Don't waste time with colonial adventures.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME166309;The Pope does not Condemn the Taiping;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC166309;The Pope did not condemn the Taiping and hopes that the new Taiping church will protect Catholics and missionaries in China.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT166309OPTA;Excellent news.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC164601_NEW;Revolutionaries seeking to bring down the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ have been stirring up a revolt in $STATENAME$. The authorities have already ambushed and cracked down on rebel cells in $PROVINCENAME$ with the help of informants, but key revolutionaries remain at large.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME6660000;Tax Refund;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC6660000;In order to avoid a liquidity crisis, money stored in treasuries is forcibly injected back into the economy. The max amount of money the treasury can hold is determined by population and Monetary System Technology. \n No other conditions met: 1 mil ¤ \n No Monetary Standard OR 4 million pops (16 million population): 2 mil ¤ \n Ad Hoc Money Printing OR 8 million pops (32 million population): 3 mil ¤ \n Private Bank Money Printing OR 16 million pops (54 million population): 4 mil ¤ \n Central Bank Money Printing OR 32 million pops (128 million population): 5 mil ¤ \n Modern Central Bank System OR 64 million pops (256 million population): 6 mil ¤ \n Market Determined Exchange Rates OR 128 million pops (512 million population): 7 mil ¤ \n Fiat Money OR 256 million pops (254 million population): 8 mil ¤  \n If you are at war, your treasury limit is increased by 1 mil ¤.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC164599_NEW;The forces of revolution have turned against the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ Government. With dissent threatening to spread into chaos, revolutionaries, mutinous New Army soldiers, and defecting governors have seized several provinces and declared a Republic of China in direct opposition to $COUNTRY_ADJ$ rule. The Beiyang Army has remained loyal to the $COUNTRY_ADJ$, however, there are signs that army leaders are holding negotiations with the revolutionaries and may launch a coup. Skirmishes between government and rebel troops have begun, and the fate of the nation is uncertain.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC12310;"A city founded upon oil, for to its inexhaustible founts of naphtha it owes its very existence, its maintenance, its prosperity... the immense output in crude petroleum from this single city far surpasses that in any other district where oil is found... the rock poured me out rivers of oil. Oil is in the air one breathes, in one's nostrils, in one's eyes, in the water of the morning bath (though not in the drinking water, for that is brought in bottles from distant mineral springs), in one's starched linen – everywhere."\n$PROVINCENAME$ is home to one of the most productive oil fields in the world, but much of its potential remained untapped until now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC166600;Generals of the Beiyang Army warn that they will be unable to protect the imperial palace if $CAPITAL$ were to fall to the rebels. They are, however, willing to negotiate with the rebels and offer a safe retirement for the Imperial Family. In case the Emperor refuses to abdicate, the generals claim that Beiyang troops are ready to assault the Imperial Palace and arrest the Imperial Court..;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC166602;Emissaries from the Beiyang Army claim the Xinhai Revolution is too weak to achieve victory on its own. Many in the Beiyang Army are dissatisfied with the Emperor as well, and offer to force him to abdicate. In exchange, the Beiyang commander will be appointed the President of China. Accepting would prevent the chaos of a brutal revolutionary war and potential foreign intervention, but the dream of a democratic China may die under Beiyang military rule.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC166603;The Beiyang Army has deposed the Emperor. The presidency of the new Republic has been given to the Beiyang, ministers replaced by Beiyang appointees, and legislators are cowed by harassment and assassination - the Beiyang have not just usurped the Empire but the Republic as well.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC166700;$COUNTRY_ADJ$ overthrow of the previous dynasty did not expel the barbarian missionaries and merchants or end the unequal treaties negotiated by the old regime. We could declare the treaties void and expel the foreigners, at the risk of drawing the ire of their home countries.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC165209;After the end of the Red Turban Rebellion, former revolutionaries having trouble adjusting to peacetime and local militas and bandits not incorporated into the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ army have turned to drugs and extortion for income. Organizing themselves into underground cells, they have joined the Sanhehui (Triple Union Society), referring to the union of heaven, earth and humanity, and are recently making moves to increase their influence in the underworld.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME165202;Truce With the Red Turbans;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC165202;Even though we are not yet done with the Red Turbans, the fact the rebels have forced us to a ceasefire and have not been crushed is being taken by our Chinese subjects as a sign of weakness. Officials are predicting rebellions in many other places in the years to come.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME165203;Truce With the Manchu;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC165203;Though we are not yet done battling the hated Manchu, for the moment the Heavenly Kingdom claims victory. We have forced a truce, and now the Manchu will need to deal with rebellions across their land as the people realize their mandate to rule no longer exists. All the world watches us.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME165204;The War Against the Red Turbans;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC165204;The continued existence of the Red Turban rebels is an embarrassment to the Qing government and our Emperor. Calls have been made for the war to resume, and this time for a national effort be started to draft men into the Qing army. There will be considerable resistance, but the Emperor has decreed that the Red Turbans must be destroyed!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME165205;The War Against the Manchu;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC165205;The truce with the Qing Emperor has come to an end, and already the calls have begun for the Red Turban Revolution to continue. The Manchu must be thrown down! All of China must be freed!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC166505;The Qing has fallen, but united the rebellion is not. Some of our leaders feel the Taiping shows the most promise in rejuvenating China. Or perhaps the whole of China should be ruled directly from $CAPITAL$?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC166506;The Qing has fallen, but united the rebellion is not. Some of our leaders believe joining the Red Turbans would serve China best. Or perhaps the whole of China should be ruled directly from $CAPITAL$?;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC6001001;Scientists in $COUNTRY$ have created a working atomic bomb. A test of their new weapon, conducted at a secret location, yielded excellent results. With continued military funding, mass production of this devastating weapon will soon be possible.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC6001002;Production of atomic bombs in $COUNTRY$ has been streamlined and a large stockpile of nuclear weapons is ready for mass deployment.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC6001100;$FROMCOUNTRY$ has annihilated several of our military installations - as well as the cities situated nearby.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC6001101;$CAPITAL$ and several cities have been struck by nuclear bombs.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC6001102;$CAPITAL$ and many cities have been struck by multiple nuclear bombs.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC6001201;We have the choice to issue two types of ultimatums, one calling for the total capitulation of our enemies which will not be so readily accepted or to demand a white peace which would be more likely to be accepted. $COUNTRY_ADJ$ military planners have also prepared a list of possible targets that can be struck in a limited nuclear attack. This can make the difference between nuclear annihilation or the greatest victory $COUNTRY$ ever had.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC6001204;$FROMCOUNTRY$ rejected our very generous demands and thus we have launched our nuclear warheads against them. Let's hope this will teach $FROMCOUNTRY$ not to mess with us anymore.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC6001205;In order to avert a nuclear war with $COUNTRY$, the $FROMCOUNTRY$ leader has agreed to surrender to $COUNTRY$ with immediate effect. As part of the agreement, the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ military forces will occupy all provinces under the control of $FROMCOUNTRY$. Elements of the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ military have however refused to surrender and continue to attack our forces. Nevertheless, a peace deal should be close.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC6001206;In order to avert a nuclear war with $COUNTRY$, the $FROMCOUNTRY$ leader has agreed to a ceasefire with $COUNTRY$. As part of the agreement, the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ and $COUNTRY_ADJ$ military forces will withdraw from all engagements with each other and seek to promote better relations to avoid another conflict. The international community has praised the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ leader for his restraint.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC6001301;An issue at a nuclear reactor has lead to the release of significant amounts of radioactive material into the environment. Concerning amounts of radioisotopes have been detected in multiple locations, and it will take time for the contaminated areas to be safe again.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
