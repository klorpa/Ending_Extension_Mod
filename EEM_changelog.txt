DNB now needs NOT = { citizens_rights = primary_culture_only  citizenship_policy = residency } to accept czech, croat, and slovene by decision, and KUK also needs it to propose the DNB to begin with

Removed southeast asian decolonization because it's a clusterfuck. Technically the militancy gain there irl was from Japan occupying it for super long anyways

Several Miao governments renamed, flags adjusted
Miao no longer gets asian_minor accepted and a bunch of free cores, but gets to use chinese reunification cb

AI China gets the cash from the self strengthening movement too

Made AI China research event slower
Yuan Shikai also needs to own Beijing to become emperor
Red Turban fascist flag changed from the 18 star iron blood flag to the Black Flag Army flag
Red Turbans no longer start with autocracy, instead they start with nv_tradition like other uncivs
Miao starts with nanfaren accepted and first_past_the_post
Abolish forced work now needs at least 90% civilization progress and no longer tries to trigger missing event 6016804
QNG conservative party 3 to be pro military instead of anti
Removed juye incident events because they are already covered by the generic westerners killed events

If you're a gp, when you get a treaty port you can demand the area around it to become a tag that is an unreleasable vassal/substate of China, but in the sphere of whoever got the treaty port, this way treaty ports actually offer you access to cheap goods instead of just milking China personally for money. 
trade zones can be expanded around 1860, (after Taiping rebellion, 2nd opium war)
trade zones can be expanded again around 1895 (boxer rebellion)
if the trade zone no longer touches its China (QNG, RTR, CHI, TPG) overlord, the trade zone becomes the puppet of the China that touches it instead
The trade zone gets absorbed if: westernized neighboring east asian country OR treaty port is owned by an east asian OR trade zone is not in a sphere
the dragon wakes event automatically annexes vassal trade zones 
if trade zone is independent and civilized, it turns into its relevant clique
    East and West Shantung -> CHI Zhili Clique
    North and South Kiangsu, South Anhwei, Chekiang -> HUI Anhui Clique
    East and West Kwangtung -> GNG
Trade zones can NOT use the chinese reunification cb, but the cb can be used against them 
Trade zones and KMT can no longer be released by the vassal sphere coup decision 
Chinese substate tech now sharing works on trade zones (there is no release_substate or create_substate command so all trade zones are vassals, not substates)
TPG/RTR victory event: can choose to puppet existing trade zones or reject unequal treaties, letting the trade zones remain independent but unable to expand, but GPs with a treaty port get a free treaty port cb
boxers, if successful, can reabsorb the trade zones and prevent new ones from forming, and gives the modifier reactionary_demands for 1 year
If China loses a treaty port war or the Boxer rebellion intervention war, tore_up_unequal_treaties flag is cleared and treaty ports can expand again
Boxer rebellion intervention war, if won, lets the attacker get a treaty port

change FACTORY_PURCHASE_MIN_FACTOR = 0.5 to FACTORY_PURCHASE_MIN_FACTOR = 1.0
	"Basically vic 2 has a mechanic where as a demand for a good lowers a factory will begin lowering its' production over time, before it starts firing workers. The problem is the mechanic is glitched, once demand increases the production is meant to increase as well but it doesn't, it'll just stay low until you reload your save (for some reason reloading fixes it). In the base game production drops to 75% but HPM changes it to drop to 50%, meaning your factories will drop to half production and stay there when demand decreases if you don't reload. Even if the demand increases later the production will not increase to previous levels due to aforementioned glitch. There is a very simple fix which is to just stop factories from lowering production when there is oversupply in the market (they'll just go straight to firing workers when they are no longer turning a profit from not being able to sell goods). Common > Defines and change FACTORY_PURCHASE_MIN_FACTOR = 0.5 to FACTORY_PURCHASE_MIN_FACTOR = 1.0"

making reunification of china decisions also annex Ming and remove Ming cores is unnecessary, warlord era doesn't happen as Ming, after Ming civilizes they become China and the warlord era happens afterwards
integrating RTR into warlord era is unnecessary, warlord era doesn't happen as Ming, after Ming civilizes they become China and the warlord era happens afterwards

Capitalsts and pops in neighboring provinces to the capital also flee with the KMT/Taiping to Taiwan. IRL: two million refugees, predominantly from the Nationalist government, military, and business community, fled to Taiwan.
