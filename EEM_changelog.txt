#interesting techs:
	foam_concrete: back to the early 1920s and the production of autoclaved aerated concrete, which was used mainly as insulation.[2] A detailed study concerning the composition, physical properties and production of foamed concrete was first carried out in the 1950s and 60s.[3][4][5] Following this research, new admixtures were developed in the late 1970s and early 80s, which led to the commercial use of foamed concrete in construction projects
	ready_mix_concrete: The first ready-mix factory was built in the 1930s. The industry did not expand significantly until the 1960s, and has continued to grow since then... reduce the consumption of cement by 10 – 12%.
	shotcrete: invented in 1907 by American taxidermist Carl Akeley to repair the crumbling façade of the Field Columbian Museum in Chicago (the old Palace of Fine Arts from the World's Columbian Exposition).[2] He used the method of blowing dry material out of a hose with compressed air, injecting water at the nozzle as it was released. In 1911, he was granted a patent for his inventions, the "cement gun", the equipment used, and "gunite", the material that was produced. The dry-mix process was used until the wet-mix process was devised in the 1950s. In the 1960s, an alternative method for gunning dry material with a rotary gun appeared, using a continuously fed open hopper.

"During 1850–70, Shaki became international silk production centre.[39] More than 200 European companies opened offices in the city, while silkworms to the tune of 3 million roubles were sold to them in a year.[39] Shaki possesses a small silk industry and relies on its agricultural sector, which produces tobacco, grapes, cattle, nuts, cereals and milk."

"Dominating spheres in the economy of Lankaran are vegetable-growing, tea-growing, paddy cultivating, cattle-breeding, citrus plants, beekeeping, fishing, and grain farming.[10] Favourable humid subtropical climate, availability of good arable land, water and sufficient labour resources of the city provides a good basis for agricultural activities as well as the development of agro-processing enterprises.

       Switzerland, which is so federal that it's barely a single country at all, and argues that its small size (or rather, the small size of each canton) has helped it stay one of the world's most stable and prosperous areas (also, Venice!). He argues that a large country isn't just a small country times X. Small countries operate partly on informal bonds of personal relationships; everybody has "skin in the game" regarding decisions. Larger countries don't just multiply everything by a constant, they switch from personal/Near Mode to bureaucratic/Far Mode and get gradually worse as they expand.

Loan Interest
    LOAN_BASE_INTEREST            = 0.02,
    inventions loan_interest = -0.002 -0.002 -0.005 -0.005 -0.005 = -0.019
    central_bank_established = -0.002
    total = -0.021
	Final interest = (1 + -0.021) * 0.02 = 0.01958

    "Loan interest is controlled primarily by the LOAN_BASE_INTEREST value (in defines.lua, monthly value), but it cannot be set below 0.01 (the game runs with 0.001, 0.00 and even with negative values, but in-game an interest rate of 0.01 is applied). This can be circumvented via the 'loan_interest' modifier, which works as a fraction of LOAN_BASE_INTEREST that is added to LOAN_BASE_INTEREST. For example with LOAN_BASE_INTEREST at 0.02, and a 'loan_interest' modifier of -1.0, the effective interest becomes 0. With a modifier of -2.0 it becomes -0.02. With a modifier of -0.5 it gets halved to 0.01."

stack overflow error caused by either a factory throughput value exceeding 400+% or one of the nations have exceeded 2.00+ billion dollars in either their national bank or national treasury.

it seems that 'local_factory_x' modifiers, including throughput, output, and etc. do not actually work. They show up on the province-view interface, but in the actual production interface, hovering over the factories' outputs make no mention of said modifiers at all, and do not seemed to be influenced by them either. There is the sole exception of infrastructure/railroads, but I would not be surprised if they were specifically hard-coded to do so.

Most of these fourteen points... would be interpreted... to mean anything or nothing."[17]

The Convention provided, "The contracting Powers shall use their best endeavours to control, or to cause to be controlled, all persons manufacturing, importing, selling, distributing, and exporting morphine, cocaine, and their respective salts, as well as the buildings in which these persons carry such an industry or trade."
		if at least 8 great powers vote yes: International Opium Convention event for everyone with opium provinces (also happens naturally if any opium province lacks the modifier)

capitalists opium want decreased to 0.2
aristocrats opium want decreased to 0.5
if province that switched to opium is unciv, it gets local_opium_habit for 5 years
Dail flips to opium not in 1860 but in 1880, Jiading no longer flips to opium
1258 Gauhati (Assam) no longer flips to opium, Assam consumed lots of opium, not produced it
Fixed reference to Galapagos when I meant Salalah in the opium flip events
Opium ban thresholds made easier, tech needed changed from social_alienation to mass_politics, ending the opium ban now depends on pro_atheism, now reduces luxury needs for everyone
banning opium immediately local ban on all opium provinces, switch away from opium unemployment threshold changed from 0.05 to 0.20
local opium ban mtth adjusted
added an opium addiction event for civs

Miao starts with nanfaren accepted and first_past_the_post
Abolish forced work now needs at least 90% civilization progress and no longer tries to trigger missing event 6016804
QNG conservative party 3 to be pro military instead of anti
Removed juye incident events because they are already covered by the generic westerners killed events

If you're a gp, when you get a treaty port you can demand the area around it to become a tag that is an unreleasable vassal/substate of China, but in the sphere of whoever got the treaty port, this way treaty ports actually offer you access to cheap goods instead of just milking China personally for money. 
trade zones can be expanded around 1860, (after Taiping rebellion, 2nd opium war)
trade zones can be expanded again around 1895 (boxer rebellion)
if the trade zone no longer touches its China (QNG, RTR, CHI, TPG) overlord, the trade zone becomes the puppet of the China that touches it instead
The trade zone gets absorbed if: westernized neighboring east asian country OR treaty port is owned by an east asian OR trade zone is not in a sphere
the dragon wakes event automatically annexes vassal trade zones 
if trade zone is independent and civilized, it turns into its relevant clique
    East and West Shantung -> CHI Zhili Clique
    North and South Kiangsu, South Anhwei, Chekiang -> HUI Anhui Clique
    East and West Kwangtung -> GNG
Trade zones can NOT use the chinese reunification cb, but the cb can be used against them 
Trade zones and KMT can no longer be released by the vassal sphere coup decision 
Chinese substate tech now sharing works on trade zones (there is no release_substate or create_substate command so all trade zones are vassals, not substates)
TPG/RTR victory event: can choose to puppet existing trade zones or reject unequal treaties, letting the trade zones remain independent but unable to expand, but GPs with a treaty port get a free treaty port cb
boxers, if successful, can reabsorb the trade zones and prevent new ones from forming, and gives the modifier reactionary_demands for 1 year
If China loses a treaty port war or the Boxer rebellion intervention war, tore_up_unequal_treaties flag is cleared and treaty ports can expand again
Boxer rebellion intervention war, if won, lets the attacker get a treaty port

The problem is the mechanic is glitched, once demand increases the production is meant to increase as well but it doesn't, it'll just stay low until you reload your save (for some reason reloading fixes it). In the base game production drops to 75% but HPM changes it to drop to 50%, meaning your factories will drop to half production and stay there when demand decreases if you don't reload. Even if the demand increases later the production will not increase to previous levels due to aforementioned glitch. There is a very simple fix which is to just stop factories from lowering production when there is oversupply in the market (they'll just go straight to firing workers when they are no longer turning a profit from not being able to sell goods). Common > Defines and change FACTORY_PURCHASE_MIN_FACTOR = 0.5 to FACTORY_PURCHASE_MIN_FACTOR = 1.0"

Oil production peaked in 1908 at 34 million barrels per year, and declined steadily to 5 million barrels in 1933. A new wave of exploration brought oil production to a new high of 140 million barrels in 1940, after which production again declined.[8] Waterflooding of old reservoirs caused a third peak of oil production in the 1950s.
