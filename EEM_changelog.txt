		make revolt events spread from country to country instead of being independent from each other

			If colony can be released as a civilized nation, they are released (with few techs and post-colonial nation tech school) (slightly stronger than just normal rebels so they don't get stomped?)
			former master has choice to let them go (prestige loss, jingoists angry, slight relations gain) or go to war to annex them vs white peace
			if the revolution is crushed, the nationalists demand independence events stop firing, and the colony calms down?
		Egypt
			releasing Egypt as a puppet in the Arab revolt having a choice of not removing your core on the Suez canal if you built it
			Egypt if not a puppet can sieze the canal (infamy and prestige gain)

making reunification of china decisions also annex Ming and remove Ming cores is unnecessary, warlord era doesn't happen as Ming, after Ming civilizes they become China and the warlord era happens afterwards
integrating RTR into warlord era is unnecessary, warlord era doesn't happen as Ming, after Ming civilizes they become China and the warlord era happens afterwards

Oil production peaked in 1908 at 34 million barrels per year, and declined steadily to 5 million barrels in 1933. A new wave of exploration brought oil production to a new high of 140 million barrels in 1940, after which production again declined.[8] Waterflooding of old reservoirs caused a third peak of oil production in the 1950s.
