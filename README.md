## Ending_Extension_Mod
This is a fork of the HPM mod of Victoria 2, that extends the end date to 1956 and adds many new features to flesh out the end game. 

This mod is now standalone, and should be run by itself. It no longer needs to be run with HPM or the Square Shaded Map Frame mod, it comes with all those 2 mods' files.

My name and trip is: Extender-anon !2RLc/0ninY 

## Featuring:

Extended play to 1956

1 new technology for each technology group

130 new inventions (120 in the new techs, 10 earlier)

Motorized infantry

Aircraft Carriers

Economic and Liquidity crisis tweaks

More China flavor (and suffering)

Please read the changelog.txt for more details.
