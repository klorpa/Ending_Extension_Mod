## Ending_Extension_Mod
This is a fork of the HPM mod of Victoria 2, that extends the end date to 1956 (so far) and adds many new features to flesh out the end game. 

This mod is now standalone, and should be run by itself. It no longer needs to be run with HPM or the Square Shaded Map Frame mod, the files are now built-in.

My name and trip is: Extender-anon !2RLc/0ninY 

## Featuring:

Extended play to 1956

1 new technology for each technology group

Over 100 new inventions

Nukes!

Motorized Infantry

Aircraft Carriers

Economic adjustments and rebalance

Improved AI

Tax refund event to prevent the liquidity crisis

A bunch of bugfixes compared to HPM

More China flavor and suffering. Trade access (sphering) of parts of China after the Taiping rebellion if you own treaty ports.

Danubian Federation cultures now guaranteed if militancy < 1 and its home country doesn't exist

Splendid Isolation option for the UK, taken from HPMP

Some of the new inventions don't have any localizations yet because they are still being rebalanced.

Please read the changelog.txt for more details.
